# Argo-Animation Data

We used Argo data from January 2004 to September 2023. Temperature differences were calculated based on an average local temperature over January 2004 to December 2018. Roemmich-GiIson Argo Climatology (2009). Code used to create the animations is available in the the associated GitHub repository: https://github.com/jmkendallbar/Argo-Animation
