## Visualizing Heat in the Deep Ocean with Argo

This website contains detailed instructions for re-creating the visualizations used in the Argo Animation produced in November 2023 for presentation at the Ocean Pavilion for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP28, in Dubai November 30-December 12, 2023.

### Heat in the deep: Scientists use Argo to track heat added to our global ocean

Description: Extreme weather events and sea level rise are increasing, intensified by a warming ocean. Understanding heat in the ocean can help better predict extreme weather and long-term climate shifts. A network of robotic instruments called Argo is helping scientists track warming beneath the surface and it's showing us the ocean's heat content is increasing steeply.  This video shares just how much the ocean is warming, and how the Argo program needs more support to continue to give society the full picture of ocean warming.

This short animation shows an increase in temperature below the ocean's surface as measured by autonomous profiling Argo floats over the course of the program's history since 2004, when float readings became dense enough to interpolate heat measurements for nearly any point on the globe. As our oceans warm, the ocean is storing more and more of the added heat in our atmosphere. When temperature change is distributed over the large ocean volume, it contains a lot of heat energy. Since the 1980s, the ocean has accumulated over 176 zetta-Joules of heat energy, roughly the equivalent of 7 billion atomic bombs. It is critical to understand this heat increase and the extent of ocean warming to better understand risks to marine life and society.

We used Argo data from January 2004 to September 2023. In the background at the beginning, we see the position of Argo floats over time. Then, we see temperature anomaly from 0 to 2000 m at 60 degrees south across the global Southern Ocean from 0 to 360 degrees. Temperature differences were calculated based on an average local temperature over January 2004 to December 2018. Roemmich-GiIson Argo Climatology (2009).

While the warming is clear, there are also some smaller, localized instances of apparent cooling, such as in the Drake's passage below South America. In this case, this is due to shifts in ocean circulation including the intensity and location of Southern Ocean zonal flow.
